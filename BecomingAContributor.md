# How to become a contributor and submit patches #

## Contributor License Agreements ##

We'd love to accept your code patches! However, before we can take them, we have to clear a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement.

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an individual CLA available at http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html.
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work to this client library, then you'll need to sign a corporate CLA available at  http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html.

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll add you to the official list of contributors and be able to accept your patches.
